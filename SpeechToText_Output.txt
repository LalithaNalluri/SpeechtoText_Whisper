Koinonia, a place of encounter with the Holy Spirit, and transformation by the principles of God's Kingdom. Give Him all the praise, all the praise and all the honor. Father, we bless you. We bless you. We desire to know you. We desire more of you. Someone pray. I have come tonight that I may know you. I have come tonight that I may see you. I have come tonight that I may learn of your ways. Say, this is life eternal, that they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus, whom thou hast sent. In Jesus' name, declare your desperation, your expectation, your desire. For in Jesus' name, we pray. In Jesus' name, we pray. The house of God is a house of revelation. The meaning of that is that when you access light, you will ascend, you will rise, leaving your former self, leaving your former situation, your former realities, and you'll rise to a new level. We take time to invest in His presence because outside of His presence, no matter what else we have, we do not have anything. Moses was speaking to a people who were already warriors. They already had the gold from Egypt. They already had the treasures, but he said, if your presence will not go with us, in spite of everything that we have, the advantage of number, the advantage of resources, but without your presence, he says, do not take us from here. It's a powerful prayer to ask God to reveal Himself to you. Hallelujah. Father, we have come tonight that you will speak to us. We have come with hearts open, hearts desperate. Spirit break out. Spirit break out. Break our walls down. Break our walls down. Spirit break out. Spirit break out. Let heaven come down. Heaven come down. One more time, let it be a cry from the depth of your heart. Spirit break out. Spirit break out. Break our walls down. Break our walls down. Spirit break out. Heaven come down. Heaven come down. We are Lord tonight. Spirit break out. Break our walls down. Spirit break out. Spirit break out. Heaven come down. Heaven come down. Let this be our experience tonight, oh God. In this place and across the airwaves. And to you be all the glory. In Jesus name we have prayed and worshipped. Give Jesus a big hand clap. Good evening everybody, please be seated. I welcome you tonight to his presence where your life will never be the same. If you believe that shout a receiving amen. Amen. I welcome everyone, those connecting online. We take time to welcome you because there are no fans in this ministry. Everyone who connects, connects by light, connects with understanding. And connects with the purpose of receiving, becoming. Hallelujah. So there are no fans. All who are connected across the globe, God has something to say. Fasten your seatbelts and I want you to pay attention because your life and your destiny is about to change. We want to especially honor those who have come from outside this city and outside this nation. It's always a joy to have you invest your time to worship with us. Because one guarantee we give you under God and by grace is that your life will never be the same. Amen and amen. The Lord placed it in my heart to remind us of two things very quickly before we get into the ministry of the word. There are two things that the Lord placed very strongly upon my heart to remind us of. And once upon a time I shared with us here what God is making out of your life and my life. It is important, faith is vision dependent. It is important you understand what God is making out of your life. Are we together? This gives you the grace to stay, to be built. If you do not know what you are becoming in righteousness, if you do not know what you are becoming by grace, you will not be encouraged to continue. You will not be encouraged to remain. And I call it the koinonia believer and the Lord impressed it upon my heart in the place of prayer to remind us again. There are about six elements. This is what you are becoming as a believer under this grace. Number one, you are becoming a spiritually vibrant believer. This is the first thing you are becoming. By reason of this immersion, by reason of your submission to this apostleship, this is what God is making out of your life. A passionate believer who is in love with Jesus and in love with the things of God. It's important for you to know that. When we take our time to invest in the atmosphere that is created per service, per meeting, it is to this intent. It is our partnership with God that you become a spiritually vibrant believer. Number two, to become a believer who is a person, a man or a woman of character. You have to take note of that. Character with a growing determination to become like Jesus in all his ramifications. A growing determination that even if you are not there yet, you must have it at the back of your mind. That week in, week out, sermon after sermon, series after series, prayer after prayer, singing and worshipping after worship. The goal is to mold you like the potter molding the clay. That you become a believer who is full of the character of the spirit. Hallelujah. Number three, God's intent, God's goal, God's vision for us all as believers under this ministry is to become intelligent and transformed believers. Transformation is a major component in all that we do. Intelligent and transformed believers. Believers whose minds have become word compliant. Believers who have a thorough understanding of the word of God alongside the dynamics of making that word work. It's not enough to have a head knowledge, a mental ascent of the word of God. You must know how to translate the word of God from prophecy to its manifestation here and now. It's called the ministry of the word, not just the preaching of the word. The ministry of the word is a holistic capture. Brings you to a point of enlightenment and helps you to see the point of application. It is the reason why our teachings are not vague. At the end of every discussion that happens upon this altar is a point of relevance and application. It is important for you to see how the thoughts, the words that you are learning, how they play out to making you a better believer and making you a more effective person. Are we learning? So your spiritual vibrancy, your character, Christ like character, intelligence and transformed believer number four. God's goal for us in making us become believers is that we become highly anointed and empowered believers. It's important for you to pay attention to this. God intends for you and I under this grace and by your discipline, your sacrifice, your consistency that you become a very anointed and empowered believer. You are only a blessing to the degree to which you are empowered. It takes beyond knowledge to create impact and to have your destiny come to fruition. You need empowerment, divine empowerment. Tarii in Jerusalem he said, until ye be endued with power from on high. Number five, what is God's goal for us as believers under this grace? And of course I believe that this also represents his intention for believers world over. Number five, to become responsible, purpose driven and effective believers. Responsible, purpose driven, effective believers. I am a strong advocate of responsible Christianity. A faith practice that helps you to have a sense of destiny that you are not just serving God arbitrarily. You are responsible, you are purpose driven. You know that God is going somewhere with you. He says, I know the thoughts that I think towards you, Jeremiah 29, 11. They are thoughts of peace and not of evil to bring you a future and unexpected end. God has unexpected end and you must know that end. Scripture says he declines the end from the beginning. Every believer must have a sense of destiny, a sense of destiny in Christ. God is taking us somewhere as individuals, families, businesses and as a ministry. Number six, the final intent behind this discipleship, this mentorship, this school of the spirit. Is that God intends to produce out of us agents of societal and territorial transformation. This is a very personal one because I think until recently most believers do not know or they do not think that they have a role to play. As far as transforming territories and societies is concerned. And I have taught you here in many series for that matter that the believer is called salt, he is called light. Are we together? He says we are the salt of the earth, Matthew chapter 5, 13 to 16. Then he says we are the light of the world. It's important for you to function as salt and to function as light. That means your praying in tongues, your Bible study, your character, your studying scripture, your falling under the anointing and standing up must be translated to a context that serves Jesus to the betterment of society. The Jesus you know, the Jesus you've come to love must be able to be a blessing to all and sundry. And this is not just to people of faith. Believers and unbelievers alike must see your impact in society. The government, the powers that be must come to reckon with the fact that your spirituality is an advantage to the civilization of your time. It's unfortunate that in many Christian circles, the government's perception of believers is that we are a bunch of fanatics who are a nuisance to advancement, a nuisance to civilization. But it ought not to be so. You are the salt of the earth. The assignment of salt is to preserve and to add value. You are the light of the world. We give illumination. The Bible defines light as that which makes manifest the glory of God now. So the first assignment I have tonight is to remind you that whilst you are seated listening to me or connected by way of the internet, have it at the back of your mind that this is what Jesus is doing in my life. That after a few weeks, a few months, one year, two years, three years, you must be able to justify your submission to this grace using these indices. So if someone asks you outside and says, tell me the benefit of your becoming part of this family. If the only thing you say is I received a miracle, you disappointed God, me, and all of us. You must have intelligence enough to defend your stay. Why have you been here? Why do you come week in, week out? Why do you listen to the messages? Why do you fast? Why do you pray? Then you can speak like a believer who has been properly mentored to this end.
